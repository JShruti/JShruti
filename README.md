### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Shruti ðŸ˜Š
I am a former technical recruiter, currently transitioning into a software engineering role.
I completed a rigorous 10-week full-stack coding boot camp at Mind-Mingle. Throughout the program, I honed my technical skills in TypeScript, HTML, and CSS using the NextJS framework to build web applications.
